Github hosting is grate and full of cool features, like *pull requests*, *network view*, *edit files* etc.
I was very impressed by the work which [Gitlab Team](http://gitlab.org/team/) did to create a clone of it.

I'd like to introduce our own instance [Speroteck Gitlab](gitlab.speroteck.com). Don't be shy, visit it and
create your own projects.

We still will work partially on github with Enterprise clients mostly, but internal projects should be hosted
on [Speroteck Gitlab](gitlab.speroteck.com)

If you still don't have account there, send a request to <dev@speroteck.com>
or directly to me <vdubyna@speroteck.com>.
